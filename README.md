# W02D01 - TDD with Mocha & Chai

### To Do
- [ ] Practicing unit testing via the Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology
- [ ] Using the Mocha BDD test framework
- [ ] Using the Chai assertion library
- [ ] Creating and consuming modules using Node's default CommonJS syntax (module.exports and require)

### TDD
- Test Driven Development
- n-Driven Development
  - test
  - behaviour
  - component
  - resume
  - error
- Unit testing
- Testing the smallest possible pieces of your code
- Red, Green, Refactor
- nothing to do with duct tape

- Red: Tests are failing
- Green: Write the minimum amount of code to make our tests pass
- Refactor: Fearless refactor

### Mocha and Chai
- Mocha is a testing framework
- Chai is an assertion library
